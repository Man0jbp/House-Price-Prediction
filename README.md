# House-Price-Prediction
This project implements a simple Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on their area. The model is built using Python and demonstrates a basic supervised learning approach.
# Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

area: Size of the house in square feet.
price: Price of the house in USD.
Sample Data
## Area (sq ft)	 /    #Price (USD)/
1) 2600	              550,000
2) 3000.              565,000
3) 3200	               610,000
4) 3600	              680,000
5) 4000	              725,000
# Project Structure
1) homeprices.csv:Dataset used for training the model.

2) Linear Regression Implementation: Python script that builds and evaluates the model.
   
3) Visualization: Graphs showing the relationship between house area and price.
# Requirements
1) Python 3.x
2) Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn
