# House-Price-Prediction
This project implements a simple Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on their area. The model is built using Python and demonstrates a basic supervised learning approach.
Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

area: Size of the house in square feet.
price: Price of the house in USD.
Sample Data
Area (sq ft)	Price (USD)
2600	550,000
3000	565,000
3200	610,000
3600	680,000
4000	725,000
Project Structure
homeprices.csv: Dataset used for training the model.
Linear Regression Implementation: Python script that builds and evaluates the model.
Visualization: Graphs showing the relationship between house area and price.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn
