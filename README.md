# House-Price-Prediction
This project implements a simple Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on their area. The model is built using Python and demonstrates a basic supervised learning approach.
# Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

area: Size of the house in square feet.
price: Price of the house in USD.
